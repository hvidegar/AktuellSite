    <h3><span>Budget </span>considerations</h3>
    <p class="head-desc">&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p>The project description should include a section with a detailed budget of the project. <br/>
	There is no budget template and the applicants have to create their own budget chart and information based on the information 
	below regarding which expenses we accept and which budget information we ask for. <br/>
	It is allowed to do the detailed budget in other currencies than SEK (Swedish krona) provided that budget summary in the project description 
	and the application form states costs in SEK.</p> 
	<br />
	<h4>Approved expense categories</h4>
	<p>Ekhagastiftelsen can grant funding for the following expense categories:</p>
	<br />
	<h5>1. Salaries</h5>
	<p>Direct costs for salaries for active staff in the project (including salary related costs that the 
	employer has to pay for taxes or charges due to collective agreements - In Swedish: LKP - lönekostnadspålägg).<br/>
	Provide information about active persons in the project with their salaries and how much of their time is spent on the project. 
	For example, person NN working 25% of his time in the project. Alternatively specify hours worked and hourly cost.<br/>
	For applications from Sweden: specify LKP separately as both amount and percentage of salaries.</p>
	<br />
	<h5>2. Equipment, instruments, materials</h5>
	<p>The foundation can fund the cost of equipment, instruments, consumables, etc. needed for the project. <br />
	The budget shall include cost details, but on an overall level. For example, there is no need to list all the 
	types of supplies that will be used.</p>
	<br />
	<h5>3. Travel</h5>
	<p>The foundation can fund the cost of travel, conferences, etc. that are required in the project.<br />
	The budget must clearly state the purpose of the trips and the overall details.</p>
	<br />
	<h5>4. Office and building costs</h5>
	<p>The foundation can fund direct costs for office and building space for the project staff listed in the Salaries section<br />
	Office and building costs should be included as a separate section in the budget, although it is to be stated 
	in the column 'Other' on the application form.</p>
	<br />
	<h5>5. Other</h5>
	<p>Other direct project-related costs such as for example financial management and IT systems.<br />
	These other costs must be specified in the budget.</p>
	<br />
	
	<h4>Indirect/Overhead-costs</h4>
	<p>Ekhagastiftelsen has a restrictive view about granting funds for overhead costs at universities and other institutions. 
	We believe that grants should only be approved for costs directly related to the projects. Some indirect costs can be 
	relevant, such as the costs of financial administration or IT, but must be specified.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Unspecified or flat rate surcharges/fees/overhead in the budget will not be accepted (Swedish example: 
	universitetspåslag). Nor does the foundation accept budget lines such as, for example, university / faculty / 
	department-wide costs, costs for management, library, education, infrastructure, etc. We also presume that no 
	surcharges are placed on the purchase of equipment and materials.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<h4>Cofinancing and grants from other organizations (if this exists)</h4>
	<p>The budget shall include a specification of the contribution that the managing body, department, college or 
	university gives to the project, so-called cofinancing, for example in the form of salaries for other staff involved in the project.</p>
	<br />
	<p>For projects that have secured or seek financing from other organizations, the total overall budget should 
	be stated and it be made clear which parts Ekhagastiftelsens funding will contribute to.</p>
