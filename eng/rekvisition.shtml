    <h3><span>Requesting </span>funds</h3>
    <p class="head-desc">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Payment of funds can be made throughout the year after request from the grant recipient. <br>
	A first payment of funds can only be made after we have received the popular scientific summary of the project. <br>
	Grants are paid for one year at a time and with up to 80 % of the yearly grant.<br>
	For grants spanning over more than one year a yearly report has to be submitted and further payments depend on 
	the quality of the yearly report.<br>	
	The remaining funds can be requested after the yearly or final report have been submitted and approved by the foundation.<br> 
	For grants over 250 000 SEK per year funds are paid per four-month or six-month period. <br>
	&raquo; Per four-month period when the payment is more than 100 000 SEK, otherwise per six-month period.<br>
	&raquo; To foreign grant recipients payments are made per six-month period. 
	<br/>
    <p>If a final report is not submitted, the foundation can ask for the repayment of funds.</p>
    <br/>
	<p>Funds not requested within 2 years of project end are revoked and used for other projects.</p>
	
    <p>There is no form for requesting payment of funds. Funds are requested by sending a letter to the foundation containing the following: </p>
	<p>&raquo; Application number,  </p>
    <p>&raquo; Project title, </p>

	<br/>
	<p><span>Note! Please also specify any specific reference that you want us to mark the payment with!</span></p>
