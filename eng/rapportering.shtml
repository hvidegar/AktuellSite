    <h3><span>Reporting </span>instructions</h3>
    <p class="head-desc">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ekhagastiftelsen uses the follwing rules regarding reporting of projects. 
	(We have borrowed some ideas from Formas  - the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning).</p> 

<p>Starting 2004, projects receiving grants must report to the foundation according to these rules. Projects that received grants before 2004 
are welcome to use these reporting rules, but the foundation can not enforce this as these rules were not in effect before 2004. </p>

<br>
<p><span>In the case reporting is not done according to these rules the foundation can freeze/revoke remaining 
funds or request repayment of funds from the recipient.</span></p>


<br>
<h4>1.	Popular scientific project description</h4>

<p>Granted projects have to send in a popular scientific project description. The text should be a short description of the 
project and what its aims are. It should not be more than 150 words in length and be written on the template that can be found 
to the right in this page. </p>
<br />
<p>The project description is to be 
sent by e-mail to info@ekhagastiftelsen.se within 2 months after the project has received information about the grant.</p>
<br />
<p>The following examples are from the Formas website and show how a popular scientific project description can be written. 
Please note that the example texts below do not have to be such projects that are applicable for Ekhagastiftelsen. The texts 
merely are examples for how a project description could be written:</p>

  The aims of the project is to study which influence increased carbon dioxide levels have on the relation between plants and 
  plant eaters. The starting point is the globally increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which have a direct 
  effect on the chemical composition of plants. This effects for example the survival, reproduction and food selection of plant 
  eating animals. Further, the potential effects of global warming (rising temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide levels) 
  on plant-plant eater interactions are to be studied. The researcher will in controlled model systems study plants and xxx at 
  different carbon dioxide levels and temperatures. These studies are e xpected to bring results for future prediction of damage 
  on important crops and effects on economically important animals.

Allergies and increased sensibility is greatest among children, and thus it is very important to study their indoor environment. 
The project focuses on studying how ventilation and airing can be optimized in school rooms. The study is carried out throuch 
CFD-simulations of air movements in school rooms and full scale trials in existing school buildings. Measurements och indoor 
climate parameters are ontinously gathered under a number of rounds. The result is expected to give guiding principles and 
recommendations for the design of ventilation systems, airing mechanisms and airing strategies, with respect to comfort and life cycle cost.

<h4>2.	Yearly report for projects spanning over more than one year</h4>

<p>For projects that have been granted financing for more than one year, a yearly report has to be submitted. 
Before the yearly report has been submitted and approved, grants for following years can not be paid out.</p>
<br />
<p>The yearly report is to be sent in within 2 monts of the end of a 12-month period counting from project start. Example: 
Project receives grant 2003-09-01. Project starts 2003-10-01. First yearly report due no later than 2004-12-01.</p>
<br />
<p>Yearly report is to be sent by e-mail to info@ekhagastiftelsen.se.</p>
<br />
<p>There is no template for the yearly report, but it has to contain the following:<br />
&raquo; Application number<br />
&raquo; Project title<br />
&raquo; Contact person<br /></p>
<br />
<p>Further it may contain:<br />
&raquo; Background, aims, theory and method<br />
&raquo; Information about what has been done under the last year<br />
&raquo; Partial results<br />
&raquo; Aims and plan for the coming year.<br /></p>
<br />
<p>The report is to be sent in as a file (word processing file, Acrobat PDF, or similar). 
Larger supplemental material such as printed reports can be sent per regular mail to the foundation. </p>
<br>


<h4>3.	Final report</h4>

<p>When the project is finished, the following reports are to be included in the final report. If funds have been received for 
parts of a larger project (for example funding for 3 years of a 10 year project that has 4 more years to go) a final report has 
to be sent in to Ekhagastifelsen at the end of the period funded by Ekhagastiftelsen.</p>
<br />
<h5>A. POPULAR SCIENTIFIC RESULT SUMMARY</h5>

<p>A popular scientific result summary has to be sent by e-mail to info@ekhagastiftelsen.se. 
A template for the summary can be found on the right side of this page.  </p>
<br />
<p>The summary should not be longer than 900 words and contain:<br />
&raquo; Background and aims of the project<br />
&raquo; Theory and method<br />
&raquo; Results from the project<br />
&raquo; Conclusion<br />
&raquo; List of publications (if applicable)</p>
<br />
<p>The popular scientific result summary has to be submitted within 3 months after project end.</p>
<br />

<h5>B. SCIENTIFIC REPORT</h5>

<p>A scientific report has to be sent per mail to Ekhagastiftelsen, Box 34 012, 100 26 Stockholm within 3 months after project end. 
As the report also is to be distributed to the scientific committee the report should also be sent per e-mail to info@ekhagastiftelsen.se 
as word processing files or Acrobat PDF files.</p>
<br />
<p>There is no template for the scientific report, but the report should contain:<br />
&raquo; Application number, project title and contact person/project manager<br />
&raquo; Introduction with aims and hypothesis<br />
&raquo; Material and methods<br />
&raquo; Result<br />
&raquo; Discussion with conclusion<br />
&raquo; Scientific publications created by the project</p>
<br />


<h5>C. FINANCIAL STATEMENT</h5>

<p>The recipient of the grant shall send in a financial statement showing all expenses for the project. 
If the grant is part of a larger project the statement shall only refer to the part financed by Ekhagastiftelsen.</p>
<br />
<p>The financial statement shall be sent in no later than 3 months after project end. A statement template can be found to the right in this page. </p>
<br />
<p>The financial statement is to be sent by regular mail (not e-mail). If needed, enclosures can be added to the statement. </p>
<br />
<p>If total expenses fall below the amount of the grant, the difference is to be paid back. </p>
<br>


<h4>4. Non-compliant reporting</h4>

<p>If reporting is not done following these rules or too late the foundation can freeze/revoke remaining funds or request repayment of funds from the recipient. </p>
<br />
<p><span>PLEASE NOTE! Project must send in reports separately from new applications! Example: a project submits a new application for a continuation of the project 
and encloses a report to the application. The project also needs to send in the report separately for the original project. </span></p>
