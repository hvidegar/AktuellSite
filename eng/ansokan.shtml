<h4>Rules regarding the application budget:</h4>

<p>A detailed budget is to be submitted as a supplement to the application. </p> 
<br />
<p>Evaluating the applications, Ekhagastiftelsen will accept the following types of costs:</p>
<br />
<p>A.	Direct costs for salaries for active personnel in the project (including reasonable salary related costs such as for example taxes 
paid by the employer - lkp (lönekostnadspålägg)), equipment/instruments, travel etc. </p>
<br />
<p>B.	Direct office/building costs for under A mentioned personnel (specification of current cost per square metre and 
norm regarding room size per person). </p>
<br />
<p>C.	Other direct project related costs such as for example administration of budget and IT-systems.  </p>
<br />
<p>In the project budget (which is to be submitted as an supplement to the application) salary costs for project personnel which can not 
be supported by other funds available to the applicant/organization, office/building costs for these persons, and other costs are to be stated.  </p>
<br />
<p>The budget shall also show which funds are given to the project by the institution/university/managing body. For example in the 
form of salaries for other personnel participationg in the project. </p>
<br />
<p>A budget item for example for unspecified university fees or unspecified overhead (for example universitetspåslag) can not be accepted.</p>
<br />
<p>More information regarding the background for these new rules can be found on a separate webpage. See link BUDGET in the menyn.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Amount that can be applied for</h4>

<p>There is no maximum amount that can be applied for in the application. Please note that in the last years the total amount awarded has 
been in the range 5-10 million SEK. We try to award approximately equal amounts towards ecological agriculture and biological medicine and 
keep the number of projects to between 10 and 20 per year. The largest amount ever awarded has been 1.500.000 SEK (for the complete application - not for one year). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Instructions for filling out the application form</h4>
<p class="head-desc">RESEARCH GRANTS</p>
<p>The primary aim of the foundation is to support research in ecological agriculture, biological medicine and the importance of 
he way of life for the human health. The application can be for up to three year long projects. For multi-year projects a yearly report must be handed in. </p>
<br />
<p class="head-desc">SCHOLARSHIPS</p>
<p>Grants can also be awarded in the form of scholarships for studies/travel relating to research within the primary goals of the foundation.</p>
<br />
<p><span>References to numbers on the form:</span>
<br />
1. &raquo; Managing body/person: The body/person who is responsible for and keeps accounts for a possible grant.<br />
2. &raquo; The project title may contain no more than 20 words. In an application for scholarship the title of related research project shall be stated.<br />
3. &raquo; A summary description of the projects, studies or travels aim/purpose, implementation and significance/importance is to be written in 
this space. A reference to a supplement is not accepted. A more detailed project description should, however, be submitted as a separate supplement. <br />
4. &raquo; Enter keywords that characterize the project. The keywords will be used for searches in a separate register.<br />
5. &raquo; Applications can be made for up to three year long projects. The budget is to be further detailed in a separate document. Amount should
be stated in SEK (Swedish kronor).<br />
6. &raquo; If an application within the same area has been or is to be sent to another organization, the applicant has to specify name of 
other organization, funds applied for and funds granted. This is in order to be able to coordinate grants with other organizations.<br />
7. &raquo; The signature of department/faculty head implies that the organization accepts administrational responsibility for 
granted funds and places resources necessary for the realization of the project at the disposal of the project.<br />
8. &raquo; If a yearly report for an earlier granted project is attached this is not enough to fulfill the reporting 
requirements of the earlier project. The project has to send in a report separately.</p>
<br />

<h4>Criteria for prioritization of applications</h4>
<p>Applications are evaluated and prioritized by a scientific advisory council. 
Based upon the councils recommendations, the board decides on award of funds at a meeting in October.</p>
<br />
<p>Prioritization criteria are:<br />
&raquo; The relevance of the project idea with respect to the aims of the foundation.<br />
&raquo; The scientific quality of method and execution, including the applicants competence for the project and for the time plan and budget presented. </p>
