    <h3><span>Purpose of the </span>foundation</h3>
    <p class="head-desc">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>The purpose of Ekhagastiftelsen is to promote human health by supporting the development of better food, natural 
	medicines and healing practices, and to support research for a healthier way of life, which in itself may have a 
	disease preventive effect.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A central idea is to focus more on preventive active care than reactive care to combat symptoms. 
	The same applies to the agricultural and food areas where the focus should be to find methods that 
	can prevent various problems instead of focusing on their manifestations.<br/>
	The focus should not be on tackling problems, but rather finding ways to prevent their occurrence.</p>
	<br/>
	<h4>Prioritized research areas</h4>
	<p>In accordance with Gösta Videgårds wishes and interests the foundation supports certain specific research areas.</p>
	<br/>
	<h5>Better and healthier food</h5>
	<p>For Gösta Videgård an important goal was the improvement in quality of agricultural products through agriculture 
	without toxins and artificial substances. The foundation therefore supports research and development based on the 
	principles of organic and biodynamic food production or other methods and orientations that promote this goal. 
	Research should be in line with IFOAMs (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) principles of organic production.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Examples of research that can be supported is how such crops that currently require pesticides can be grown 
	organically in a qualitative and efficient way to produce better and healthier food.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Research on improved preparation and storage of food, as well as the analysis of food quality can receive support.</p>
	<br/>
	<h5>Nutrition and way of life</h5>
	<p>Gösta Videgård was very interested in significance of the diet for humans. The Foundation therefore supports 
	research into the role of the diet in the treatment of diseases and strengthening the body's resistance.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Examples of funding can be research into which type diet and food the body needs, the impact of different 
	food choices on bodily functions and related nutritional issues.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Healthier lifestyles, a cleaner environment and a more active outdoor lifestyle was also important to 
	Gösta Videgård and he wished that the foundation should work to promote such development. 
	Ekhagastiftelsen can therefore support scientific research in this area. </p>
	<br/>
	<h5>Complementary medicine and natural medicines</h5>
	<p>Gösta Videgårds had a keen interest in complementary medicine and its goal of curing diseases by using the body's 
	own innate healing abilities and utilize natural healing powers. He appreciated and also practiced the 
	basic idea of avoiding artificial chemicals as far as possible.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Ekhagastiftelsen recognizes that today support for this area of research can be extended to include also other medical 
	research where the mindset is to utilize natural methods and medicines, and for example, can go 
	under the names integrative, biological or alternative medicine.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>There are mental and psychological aspects in complementary medicine, and research in this direction can also 
	be supported. However, our view is that research on the physical impact and bodily functions have higher 
	priority than research on mental health and psychology.</p>
	<br/>
	<h4>Which applications can receive grants?</h4>
	<p>The main focus should be on scientific research and primarily applied research. Basic research in areas such 
	as for example molecular biology and genetic research can be supported if it clarifies causal relationships 
	that can be considered to be of direct value for further research related to foundation's purpose.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In addition to funding scientific research, the foundation can, to a lesser extent, grant funding for 
	projects designed to have research findings put into practice, for example, training activities, 
	documentation projects, book projects or conferences. Such applications must contribute to a 
	development in line with the foundation's purpose.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The foundation also welcomes applications for planning grants. These can be for organizing seminars / workshops 
	on the issue that the applicant wants to study, in order to get a better basis for a definite application 
	(which can also be directed to other funding bodies) and as part of a dialogue between scientists and the 
	scientific advisory council.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Ekhagastiftelsen wishes primarily to support strategic and innovative projects of a pilot nature, 
	as well as research that is highly newsworthy and that not just confirms previous findings. The foundation 
	also supports participatory research projects, in which, for example, farmers and scientists work together 
	to identify research questions and methods, and jointly evaluate the results.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>It is possible to apply for scholarships, but this is usually only granted for research-related projects. 
	The foundation does not sponsor basic education at university level.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Ekhagastiftelsen does not support aid projects where, for example, the project plans to 
	develop societal functions or conduct training.	</p>
